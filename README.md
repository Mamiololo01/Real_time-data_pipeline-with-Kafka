# Real_time-data_pipeline-with-Kafka
Implement real time data streaming application using Kafka, AWS Athena, Glue and S3 bucket.



In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on Real-Time Stock Market Data using Kafka.
We are going to use different technologies such as Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL.

## Technology Used
Programming Language - Python
Amazon Web Service (AWS)
1. S3 (Simple Storage Service)
2. Athena
3. Glue Crawler
4. Glue Catalog
5. EC2
Apache Kafka including installing Java runtime.

## Procedures
Install Apache Kafka on EC2 by installing an EC2 instance and install Zookeeper, KafkaConsumer and KafkaProducer on the ec2 instance on AWS. Kindly ensure the instance-type has enough resources for the Apache Kafka. You will need to open 3 differenet VM tabs for the dependencies.

Create an S3 bucket for data ingestion.


Configure a lambda function, use runtime as python and add the python code on the configuration tab and deploy.
